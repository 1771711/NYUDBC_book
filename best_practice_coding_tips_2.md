## Programming style

Yes, style counts.  We're not only trying to get something done, we're also communicating with others who may look at our code and possibly use it.  A clear style makes that communication more effective.

With that in mind, here are some guidelines we've found useful:

* Put an overall summary of your program at the top in triple quotes.  This should include both the purpose of the program and your name.  Your email address is optional.
* Lines should be no longer than 79 characters.
* Skip two lines before and after a function definition.
* Skip lines here and there where you think it makes sense.
* Use comments whenever something isn't immediately obvious (and sometimes even when it is).

You can find more along these lines in the classic "[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)" and Google's [style guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html).

Some programmers are religious about this.  We'd say simply that we want to make our code readable by others.

There's one other thing we often do.  If we find documentation online -- at Stack Overflow, for example -- we put  a link to it in the code for future reference.
